1) install react bootstrap 
    - npm i react-bootstrap bootstrap

2) Bootswatch thme  and import at index.js 

3) install react router dom
    - npm i react-router-dom
    place <App/> inside <BrowserRouter> tag in index.js



for Redux
---------

npm install @reduxjs/toolkit
npm install react-redux

axios
------
npm i axios


thunk
------

- thunk accepts an action type string and a function that returns a promise, and generate a thunk that dispatches pending/fullfilled/rejected action types based on that promise.
- thunk is not a part of slice. but its a method in toolkit.

- - createAsyncThunk method is used for creating thunk
   ------------------
- builder -  hold response or values from thunk
  --------


steps
------
1) create store
2) mention store inside the index.js 
    - place <App/> inside provider tag to make store globally accessible.
3)create slice


- javascript resolving asynchronous function (API call) based on the concept 'promise based'
- states of promise are : - pending
                          - reject 
                          - resolve
- in this project api call is doing inside slice.
- so we need to mention all three states of promise.
- in other projects (e-cart) api call is done inside useFetch hook (customised hook), so we only need to mention only the resolve state inside the slice

-slice is a syncronous function and api call is asynchronous function.
-so we can't directly do api call inside slice.
- so we use thunk concept for this
- createAsyncThunk method is used for creating thunk
